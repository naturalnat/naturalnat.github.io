The CLI Gem Portfolio Project was the first project of the program. It required building a CLI app that would have multiple layers of data and be interactive. My project provided a list of NYC Elected Offices. The menu allows the user to enter a number corresponding to an office to receive information on who the elected official is. This was inspired by my experience as an undergrad student, and working with policy in general - sometimes I just wished for a simple list of the elected officials who are most often mentioned/contacted. So I went from there.  

Beginning the project was intimidating. The walkthrough videos that were posted on the assignment page helped a lot. After getting the bin files set up and working, coding the rest of the methods that would display a menu and the results was not so bad -- I felt relatively confident after all of the lab work in coding those methods. 

The scraper was one of the more frustrating components of the lab to build and took a lot of trial and error to get working in order for it to be able to list the NYC Council website and list the Council Members. Other Officials, like the Borough Presidents and the Mayor, I hardcoded, so only current elected officials are retured. This is something I would like to expand on in the future, in addition to including more options for elected offices and information about them to be returned. 

Overall, I am quite proud of what I have done, even though I recongize all its flaws and areas that could be improved. I never expected to have been doing this.
