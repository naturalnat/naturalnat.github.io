I've been fascinated with computers and programming languages since I was younger. From watching "hackers" on TV, to seeing and hearing about the work my friends do (many of whom are software engineers), I thought that world was too complex for me. I was never good at math, or science, so I was even more intimidated. 

I have a BA in Political Science and Urban Studies. My last few semesters were the most inspiring. I took a Political Science course on Cybersecurity. The professor had a degree in Computer Science, and a PhD in Law. She served in the US Navy for 7 years. She taught us about the intersection of policy and computers. I wanted to be just like her, but I buried that and continued my pubic policy path. 

It wasn't until my last semester when somebody at my internship suggested I learn some programming languages like Python and SQL so I can work on research/data projects. Another one of my professors, Gale Brewer (also the Manhattan Borough President), once casually mentioned in class the relationship between tech and policy. After some months of mulling over it, a conversation with an acquantance, and a Facebook message with a link to Flatiron, I am now doing things I've been telling myself for at least a decade are beyond my capacity and out of my reach.
